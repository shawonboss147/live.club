<p><strong>Taylor Swift has become the first artist in history to claim every slot in the top 10 of the US singles chart.</strong></p>



<p>She overtakes Drake, who held the previous record of nine top 10 singles in September 2021. Before him, the Beatles scored eight top 10s in 1964.</p>



<p>Swift&#8217;s chart domination is thanks to her latest album, Midnights, which has become 2022&#8217;s fastest-selling release.</p>



<p>&#8220;10 out of 10 of the Hot 100??? On my 10th album??? I AM IN SHAMBLES,&#8221; tweeted the pop star.</p>



<p>The 32-year-old claims the number one spot with the single Anti-Hero, whose chorus, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s me. Hi! I&#8217;m the problem, it&#8217;s me</em>,&#8221; has quickly become a Tik Tok trend.</p>



<p>The rest of the top 10 includes album tracks like Lavender Haze, Maroon, Snow On The Beach, Bejewelled and Karma.</p>



<p>All 13 of the songs on Midnights&#8217; standard edition make the top 15, interrupted only by Sam Smith&#8217;s Unholy at 11 and Steve Lacy&#8217;s Bad Habits at 12.</p>



<p>The seven bonus tracks from Midnights&#8217; deluxe &#8220;3am edition&#8221; appear between numbers 20 and 45.</p>



<p>Swift took fans by surprise when she announced the new album in the closing moments of the 2022 MTV VMAs in New Jersey in August.</p>



<p>She has described the record as the story of &#8220;13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life&#8221; and &#8220;a journey through terrors and sweet dreams&#8221;.</p>



<p>It sees the star return to the pop palette of her pre-pandemic albums, after the homespun indie-folk of Evermore and Folklore, both released in 2020.</p>



<p>But the subdued sounds of those records persists, and her late-night tales are painted in more muted tones than hits like Shake It Off and Lover.</p>



<p>Part of its success is due to a clever marketing campaign, which saw the album released in multiple collectible formats &#8211; including four vinyl editions which combine to make a clock.</p>



<p>But Billboard reported that Swift&#8217;s Top 10 takeover would have been achieved by streams alone, before sales and radio play were counted.</p>

<p>Midnights debuted at number one in the US album chart, selling 1.4 million copies &#8211; with more than one million of those on CD and vinyl, an almost unheard of figure in the streaming era.</p>



<p>The album similarly tops the UK chart with sales of 204,000, making it the first album to crack the 200,000 sales barrier since Adele&#8217;s 30 just under a year ago.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, that figure represents the biggest first-week sales of Swift&#8217;s UK chart career. Her previous best was for the album 1989, which shifted 90,300 copies in 2014.</p>



<p>However, she cannot replicate her domination of the US singles countdown &#8211; due to a UK chart rule that only allows three songs by one artist to appear in the Top 100 at the same time.</p>



<p>Without that restriction, Swift would have had eight of this week&#8217;s top 10 singles. Instead, she has to content herself with being number one (Anti-Hero), three (Lavender Haze) and four (Snow On The Beach).</p>



<p>Last week&#8217;s number one, Sam Smith&#8217;s Unholy, clings on at number two, denying Swift a clean sweep at the top of the charts.</p>



<p>Billboard magazine said Swift&#8217;s latest album had helped her break several records.</p>



<p>She now boasts the most top 10 hits among women in the chart&#8217;s history, with her total of 40 surpassing Madonna&#8217;s 38. Amongst all acts, she trails only Drake, who has 59 top 10s.</p>



<p>Midnights is also the first album in history to spawn 10 top 10 singles.</p>



<p>Swift also broke records for the most streams of a single album in one day on Spotify, Apple and Amazon Music.</p>



<p>In the UK, Midnights sold 62,000 copies on vinyl alone &#8211; the highest weekly sale for any vinyl album in the 21st century.</p>
