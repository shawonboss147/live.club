<p>If you are a California consumer, you have the right, at any time, to direct a business that sells your personal information to third parties to not sell your personal information. This right is referred to as the right to opt-out. You may exercise your right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information through Reuters.com by clicking here. You do not have to create an account to exercise this right.</p>



<p>Please note that opting-out may not mean you will stop seeing advertisements. Additionally, in the event you opt-out under CCPA, but do not opt out of interest-based advertising more generally, you may still receive advertisements tailored to your interests based upon your Personal Information. For more information about your rights as a California consumer and to learn more about our use of interest-based advertising and additional opt-out choices, please see our Privacy Statement.</p>
